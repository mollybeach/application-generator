# Features
## The "application-generator" has the following features:

## Random project names: The tool generates random project names by combining a random animal name, a random fruit name, and a random code file extension.
### Random programming language and framework: The tool selects a random programming language and framework for the new project from a list of supported programming languages and frameworks.
Project creation: The tool creates a new project using the selected programming language and framework, by running the appropriate command to start a new project.
README.md file: The tool automatically generates a README.md file for the new project, with the project name as the title.
AI description: The tool uses AI to generate a project description for the new project, which is included in the README.md file.
GitHub integration: The tool pushes the new project to GitHub, making it easy to share and collaborate on your new project.

The OpenAI Python package provides a Python interface to the OpenAI API. You can install the package using pip:

<pre><code>
pip install openai
</code></pre>

# Modifying the Application-Generator

To use OpenAI to generate project names and descriptions, you will need to modify the Application-Generator script. Here are the steps to modify the script:

Import the OpenAI package at the beginning of the script:

<pre><code>
import openai
</code></pre>

Initialize the OpenAI package with your API key:

<pre><code>
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
</code></pre>

Use the OpenAI package to generate project names and descriptions:
